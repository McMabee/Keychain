# Keychain
The final project of my course COSC 1P03. It's a program that will go through a set floorplan and find your "keys". Floorplans are .txt documents

Floor plans are 5 characters tall and 10 characters wide. 
"O" is an object the program cannot traverse i.e. a wall.
"S" can be traversed by the program.
"K" are the keys, and when the program is overtop of the keys the program will stop.
"M" is the program's position. Where ever the "M" is placed is where the program will start.
